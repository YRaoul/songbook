{eot}

To [G]everyone who's lost someone they love
[C]Long before it was their time.
You [Em]feel like the days you had were not enough
When you [D]said goodbye.

And to [G]all of the people with burdens and pains
[C]Keepin' you back from your life.
You [Em]believe that there's nothing
And there is no one who can [D]make [Dsus]it righ[D]t.

There is [C]hope for the helpless, [G]rest for the weary,
And [Em]love for the broken [D]hearts.
There is [C]grace and forgiveness, [G]mercy and healing
He'll [Em]meet you wherever you [D]are.

Cry out to [C]Jesus. Cry out to [G]Jesu[C]s.[Am][D]

For the [G]marriage that's struggling just to hang on
They [C]lost all of their faith in love.
And they've [Em]done all they can to make it right again
Still it's [D]not [Dsus]enoug[D]h.

For the [G]ones who can't break the addictions and chains
You [C]try to give up but you come back again.
Just [Em]remember that you're not alone
In your shame and your [D]suf[Dsus]ferin[D]g.

There is [C]hope for the helpless, [G]rest for the weary,
And [Em]love for the broken [D]hearts.
There is [C]grace and forgiveness, [G]mercy and healing
He'll [Em]meet you wherever you [D]are.

Cry out to [C]Jesus[C].[C][C]

[Em]When you're lonely,
[D]and it feels like the [G]whole world is falling on [C]you,
[Em]You just reach out, [D]you just cry out to [C]Jesus
[C]Cry to Jesus.

To the [G]widow who suffers from being alone,
[C]Wipin' the tears from her eyes.
For the [Em]children around the world without a home,
Say a [D]prayer [Dsus]tonigh[D]t.

There is [C]hope for the helpless, [G]rest for the weary,
And [Em]love for the broken [D]hearts.
There is [C]grace and forgiveness, [G]mercy and healing
That [Em]meets you wherever you [D]are.
THERE IS [C]HOPE FOR THE HELPLESS, [G]REST FOR THE WEARY,
AND [Em]LOVE FOR THE BORKEN [D]HEARTS
There is [C]grace and forgiveness, [G]mercy and healing
That [Em]meets you wherever you [D]are.

Cry out to [C]Jesus. Cry out to [G]Jesu[C]s.
Cry out to [G]Jesu[C]s. Cry out to [G]Jesu[C]s.
